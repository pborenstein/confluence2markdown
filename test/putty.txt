You can use PuTTY to generate your SmartMachine SSH key. PuTTY is a free open-source terminal emulator that functions much like the Terminal application in Mac OS X in a Windows environment. If you prefer a command line approach to SSH, you can use [Cygwin|http://www.cygwin.com/] to emulate a Linux-like environment on your Windows machine.

h1. About PuTTY

PuTTY is an SSH client for Windows that you will use to generate your SSH keys. You can download PuTTY from [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/].

When you install the PuTTY client, you also install the PuTTYgen utility. PuTTYgen is what you will use to generate your SSH key for a Windows VM.

{note}
This page gives you basic information about using PuTTY and PuTTYgen to log in to your provisioned machine. For more information on PuTTY, see the official&nbsp;[PuTTY documentation|http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html].

h1. Generating an SSH Key

To generate an SSH key with PuTTYgen, follow these steps:

# Open the PuTTYgen program.
# For *Type of key to generate*, select&nbsp;*SSH-2 RSA*.
# Click the *Generate* button.
# Move your mouse in the area below the progress bar. When the progress bar is full, PuTTYgen generates your key pair.
# Type a passphrase in the *Key passphrase* field. Type the same passphrase in the *Confirm passphrase* field. You can use a key without a passphrase, but this is not recommended.
# Click the *Save private key* button to save the private key.
{note}
You *must* save the private key. You will need it to connect to your machine.
{note}
# Right-click in the text field labeled *Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file* and choose *Select All*.
# Right-click again in the same text field and choose *Copy*.

h1. Uploading an SSH Key

Now you need to upload the copied SSH key to your Cloud Management portal.

# After you copy the SSH key to the clipboard, return to the Cloud Management portal.
# In the&nbsp;*SSH Key* field, paste your SSH key.
# In the *Name* field, provide a name for the key. {info}Providing a key name is optional but is a good practice for ease of management.{info}
# Click the *Add this key* button. See below.

{note}
PuTTY and OpenSSH use different formats of public SSH keys. If the text you pasted in the *SSH Key* starts with {{---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY}}, it is in the wrong format. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Your key should start with {{ssh-rsa AAAA...}}.
{note}

Once you upload your SSH key to the portal, you can [connect to your virtual machine|jpc2:Connecting to Your Machine from Windows] through a PuTTY session.



h1. What is my next step?

The final step is to [provision a machine|jpc2:Provisioning a Machine] and start using the Joyent Public Cloud\!
